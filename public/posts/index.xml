            <description>My name is Polo, I am a Pharmacy Technician turned Epic Willow Analyst.
This is my website it is a work in progress as I am thinking of ways to fill this up with content that will be useful to those who find it. This is something I have been trying to do for a long time for people who often have questions for me about how I got to be where I am in my professional career.</description>
