My name is Polo, I am a Pharmacy Technician turned Epic Willow Analyst.

This is my website it is a work in progress as I am thinking of ways to fill this up with content that will be useful to those who find it. This is something I have been trying to do for a long time for people who often have questions for me about how I got to be where I am in my professional career.

Some things I would recommend:
- Go to the About page and read about my journey.
- Follow and connect with me on LinkedIn (link to my social on main page).
- Read my pinned posts on LinkedIn for any questions you may have.
- Email me if you have any questions (link to my email on the main page) and reach out to me on LinkedIn.

Stay Tuned!
